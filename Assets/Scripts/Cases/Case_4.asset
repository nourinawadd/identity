  caseDescription: 'During a historic cinema tribute night, a restored golden film
    reel vanished from a private archive display shortly before a major retrospective
    screening. The disappearance was only noticed after guests were ushered into
    the main theater.

    A stage manager recalled seeing a respected international
    film star browsing the archive collection while discussing classic cinema influences
    with historians. Several volunteers later mentioned the individual politely greeting
    reporters from Asian entertainment networks while adjusting a long hairstyle
    that draped loosely over their formal attire''s shoulders.

    Security cameras
    captured the suspect exiting the archive wing and returning calmly to the guest
    seating area just as the lights dimmed for the opening presentation.'
