  caseDescription: "The Silver Lantern Film Festival premiere encountered unexpected
    delays when the official orchestral soundtrack prepared for the opening ceremony
    was replaced with an entirely different musical score moments before playback.
    Audio engineers confirmed that someone with backstage clearance had accessed
    the digital performance archive shortly before guests arrived.\nEvent staff remembered
    a globally touring recording artist visiting the sound department earlier that
    evening, enthusiastically discussing production layering techniques and studio
    experimentation with audio engineers. A production intern later recalled the
    performer\u2019s appearance being particularly recognizable due to how their
    tightly patterned hairstyle interacted with stage lighting during previous performances
    at the festival.\nA costume designer who briefly spoke with the suspect mentioned
    that their performance persona often relied on strong, textured stage presence
    supported by bold lighting effects that emphasized facial definition during live
    shows. Several crew members also remembered the individual speaking about collaborative
    music projects across both American and African music markets.\nBy the time the
    correct soundtrack files were restored, the performer had already returned to
    the main event floor, greeting fans and posing for photographers during live
    media coverage."
