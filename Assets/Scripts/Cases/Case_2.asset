  caseDescription: "During a charity film gala, organizers reported that a confidential
    script scheduled for auction was stolen from the VIP writer\u2019s lounge. The
    theft happened shortly after several film stars were escorted inside to review
    the script for promotional endorsements.\nA bartender recalled the suspect confidently
    discussing upcoming film roles with producers while waiting for a private meeting
    to begin. Another witness mentioned that the individual had arrived directly
    from the red carpet and appeared slightly wind-swept, with their hair cropped
    neatly and styled.\nSecurity logs later showed the suspect leaving the lounge
    carrying a folder identical to the one used for the script presentation. Event
    staff remembered the person interacting warmly with fans from across Europe while
    signing memorabilia just minutes before the alarm was raised."
