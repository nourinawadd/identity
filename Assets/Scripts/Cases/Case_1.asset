  caseDescription: "The closing act of the Global Harmony Awards was delayed after
    a ceremonial sapphire-studded microphone disappeared moments before it was meant
    to be presented on stage. The room had just emptied from a high-energy performance
    when technicians noticed the display case was unlocked.\nOne lighting assistant
    recalled seeing the suspected individual slipping behind the stage curtain while
    humming a melody that had just been performed live moments earlier. Security
    later confirmed that the suspect had been moving between the performers\u2019
    lounge and the vocal warm-up rooms throughout the evening. Several staff members
    mentioned how the person casually tied their hair back before entering a restricted
    area, as if preparing to avoid drawing attention.\nLater footage showed the easily-recognizable
    individual speaking with international press about their latest global tour and
    collaborations across multiple countries. By the time the missing microphone
    was discovered, the suspect was already posing for after-party photos near the
    main ballroom entrance."
