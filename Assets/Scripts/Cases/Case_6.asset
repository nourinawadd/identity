  caseDescription: 'The Global Harmony Music Festival was preparing for its highly
    anticipated closing performance when a custom-designed finale costume vanished
    from a secured wardrobe suite. Production assistants reported seeing a chart-dominating
    vocalist entering the restricted dressing corridor between rehearsal breaks.
    Several dancers remembered the performer chatting casually with costume designers
    about last-minute choreography adjustments and upcoming international tour stops.

    A
    wardrobe coordinator distinctly recalled the suspect because their hair moved
    freely behind them as they rushed between fitting stations, catching the light
    from the mirrored dressing panels. Another stylist mentioned that the performer
    possessed striking and uniquely recognizable facial details that stood out even
    when partially concealed by stage lighting and rehearsal makeup.

    Later that
    evening, journalists stationed near the backstage entrance reported overhearing
    the suspect enthusiastically discussing collaborations across multiple music
    genres and continents. By the time the costume department realized the final
    outfit was missing, the individual had already returned to center stage rehearsals,
    confidently running through choreography while surrounded by backup performers.'
