  caseDescription: "At an international fashion premiere, a rare emerald necklace
    intended for the finale runway suddenly appeared to be replaced with an imitation.
    The switch likely occurred while stylists and performers were rotating through
    the dressing suites.\nOne wardrobe assistant remembered a performer stepping
    into the jewelry room shortly after finishing a soundcheck rehearsal for the
    evening\u2019s musical showcase. The assistant noted the performer's tight curls
    as they leaned over the accessory table to examine the display pieces.\nLater,
    the suspect was overheard discussing their recent chart success across multiple
    continents while speaking to journalists near the photographers\u2019 section.
    A security volunteer also recalled the performer\u2019s sharp confidence when
    navigating crowded backstage hallways, suggesting someone accustomed to commanding
    massive live audiences."
